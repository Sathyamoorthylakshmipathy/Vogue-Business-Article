<p>Luxury’s largest conglomerates have enjoyed the biggest share gains this year. However, some disruptive players, such as newly listed Farfetch and Gen Z-focused turnaround brand Hugo Boss, have also powered ahead, indicating areas of opportunity for the industry.</p>

<p>A rising tide lifts all boats, but share prices of the luxury giants have been well ahead of the market average over the last 12 months. “It’s a matter of organic growth and profit performance continuing to be very strong,” says Luca Solca, senior research analyst for global luxury goods at Bernstein. “That is in a context in which many other sectors suffered... The industry has been on the right side of the line both in terms of growth and profit.”</p>

 <p>Sales are marginal in 2020 across all brands.<a href="#story/1151660/slide-1"></a></p>

<p>Smaller brands have failed to see the same kind of returns in <span class="redtext">2021</span> . The influence of size on success has been demonstrated throughout the pandemic.<a href="#story/1151660/slide-2"></a></p>

<p>While luxury’s biggest players aren’t necessarily widening their lead by accelerating their businesses, smaller companies are struggling to close the gap, says Jeffries analyst Kathryn Parker.<a href="#story/1151660/slide-2"></a></p>
  
  <p>Luxury brands are also benefiting from a higher number of, and the spending power of, millennials across all regions.<a href="#story/1151660/slide-2"></a></p>

<h1>The China opportunity</h1>

<p>Most countries that see high rates of gun violence are also economically depressed. The chart below shows that, generally, it's the poorer countries that see high rates of violence.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1151707?807943"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
  
<p>Share prices were all on the raising side until August.<a href="#story/1151707/slide-1"></a></p>
  
<p>The luxury sector had “wobbled” in the summer, notes Parker, related to the narrative around the Chinese government’s ‘common prosperity’ policy initiative.<a href="#story/1151707/slide-2"></a></p>

<p>“The market didn't necessarily know how to interpret that initially. There are rumblings of tax rises on the wealthy in China.”<a href="#story/1151707/slide-2"></a></p>

<p>From October, Luxury share prices have actually had a strong recovery from the summer onwards. It's almost as if the ‘common prosperity’ potential issues have not appeared.<a href="#story/1151707/slide-3"></a></p>

  <p>A rising tide lifts all boats, but share prices of the luxury giants have been well ahead of the market average over the last 12 months. “It’s a matter of organic growth and profit performance continuing to be very strong,” says Luca Solca, senior research analyst for global luxury goods at Bernstein. “That is in a context in which many other sectors suffered...

<h1>End of the story </h1>

<p>But as long as it's easy for firearms to be transported from, say, a gun-friendly state (like Nevada) to a state with strong gun laws (like California), as long as lawmakers fail to enact strong policies to restrict sales to people with mental illnesses or a history of violence, as long politicians continue to take money from the gun industry, as long as the gun lobby continues to pressure medical doctors to stop advocating for their patients with bullet wounds, and as long as a box of ammunition for an AR-15 rifle costs $20 for 50 rounds, the shootings will no doubt continue.</p>
